# TOP Private Events Project

[project link](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations)

Project to practice Active Record querying principles.  The assignment will mimic an Eventbrite like event organization app.  Users can sign up and login simply with a username.   They can create events and invite other users to them.  Events can be edited and deleted by the creator.  Events are ordered by date and separated by past/upcoming events.  

Built using Ruby on Rails and Tailwind CSS for styling
